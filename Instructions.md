## Project Rubric
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the [Restaurant Reviews project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view). Please review for detailed project requirements. The rubric should be a resource you refer to periodically to make sure your project meets specifications.

## Get the Starter Code
To begin, go ahead and clone the starter code from [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1). The code provided will serve as your baseline to begin development.

## Development Strategy
1. **Get a** [MapBox API key](https://www.mapbox.com/install/)
  * If you do not already have a MapBox account, go ahead and create one
  * MapBox API is free to use (no need to provide any payment information)
  * If you would like to use Google Maps, there is a `google-maps` branch of the starter code. You'll need your own [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
1. **Get the map on the screen**
  * Head over to your account and create a token. Replace the text `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` inside of `main.js` with your key
  * Using Google Maps instead? Replace the text `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `index.html` and `restaurant.html` with your own key
  * Now, what about rendering the map for individual restaurants? Check out `restaurant_info.js`. Where would be a good spot to place your API key?
1. **Convert the provided site to use a responsive design**. All responsiveness should be done with CSS (Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used)
  * Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags. Where would you add these tags in the `index.html` and `restaurant.html` files?
  * How does everything look after adding the appropriate tags? Are there any existing style values in `styles.css` that we can immediately fix to make things more dynamic? Hint: how does using a `%` value differ from using a strict `px` value?
  * Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS. Items such as the `restaurants-list` would be a great place to start. What attributes can you add to make sure these items fit a mobile screen (i.e., a smaller viewport)?
  * Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
  * Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device. For a more in-depth look at responsive images, check out our [Responsive Images](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882) course
1. **Implement accessibility features in the site HTML**
  * How can you use attributes like `tabindex` to indicate if (or where) an element sits in keyboard navigation order (e.g., by pressing the `Tab` key on the keyboard)? What will be your first element? Your next?
  * Note that most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions (e.g., restaurant item HTML). How can we [use JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/tabIndex) directly to create a tab index for each element desired?
  * What about semantics? Which attributes can we add (and to which page elements) to reflect an element's role?
  * Be sure to make both your main page and restaurant detail page accessible for users
1. **Add a ServiceWorker script** to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets (so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline)
  * Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features
  * Which file(s) would you need to register a service worker? Be sure to have a file ready to handle the service worker
  * After the service worker is properly registered, which event(s) are you listening for? What is/are the response(s)?

One more note: **you may use external JavaScript libraries**, but UI frameworks may not be used. This includes (but is not limited to) jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, etc.
